# Safe threshold set incorrectly by `reconcileSignerCount`

## Summary

The `reconcileSignerCount` function always sets the safe threshold to the total number of valid signers.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the `reconcileSignerCount` function, logic is in place to determine a new safe threshold based on `currentThreshold`, `validSignerCount`, and `targetThreshold`.
```solidity
uint256 currentThreshold = safe.getThreshold();
        uint256 newThreshold;
        uint256 target = targetThreshold; // save SLOADs

        if (validSignerCount <= target && validSignerCount != currentThreshold) {
            newThreshold = validSignerCount;
        } else if (validSignerCount > target && currentThreshold < target) {
            newThreshold = target;
        }
```

However, when `changeThreshold` is called on the safe, it is passed `validSignerCount` instead of the `newThreshold` value that was determined.
```solidity
            bytes memory data = abi.encodeWithSignature("changeThreshold(uint256)", validSignerCount);
```

## Impact

This results in any intended threshold set by wearers of the owner hat being overridden every time the `reconcileSignerCount` function is executed. 

For example, if there 9 signers and the owners set the target threshold to 5, they would not actually be able to approve a transaction unless all 9 signed the transaction. This is because `checkTransaction` calls `reconcileSignerCount`, which would update the threshold to 9 ahead of the signatures being verified and counted.

## Recommendation

Pass in `newThreshold` instead of `validSignerCount` when encoding the call to `changeThreshold(uint256)`.
```diff
-   bytes memory data = abi.encodeWithSignature("changeThreshold(uint256)", validSignerCount);
+   bytes memory data = abi.encodeWithSignature("changeThreshold(uint256)", newThreshold);
```
