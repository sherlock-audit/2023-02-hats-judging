# Setting wrong variable to signer threshold of the Gnosis safe

## Summary
Safe's signer threshold is being updated, but instead setting it to the intended new threshold value, full signer count is assigned.
## Vulnerability Detail
In HatsSignerGateBase::reconcileSignerCount() the new threshold for signers is calculated, but then the safe::changeThreshold() is called with validSignerCount instead of the newThreshold.
## Impact
This may prevent multisig safe transactions as it removes the buffer between available signers and the needed threshold - requiring all the signers to sign instead of only some.
