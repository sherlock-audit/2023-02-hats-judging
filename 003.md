# Hats.supportsInterface function should not return true for ERC1155

## Summary
The `Hats` contract inherits from `ERC1155` which exposes the public `supportsInterface` function:

```solidity
function supportsInterface(bytes4 interfaceId) public view virtual returns (bool) {
    return
        interfaceId == 0x01ffc9a7 || // ERC165 Interface ID for ERC165
        interfaceId == 0xd9b67a26 || // ERC165 Interface ID for ERC1155
        interfaceId == 0x0e89341c; // ERC165 Interface ID for ERC1155MetadataURI
}
```

So the `supportsInterface` function returns `true` for ERC1155 which is wrong.

## Vulnerability Detail
The developer is aware that the `Hats` contract is not compliant with the ERC1155 standard.

Quoting from the contest page:  
> However, because Hats tokens are non-transferable by their owner ("wearer"), Hats Protocol does not implement the ERC1155 Token Receiver logic. As a result, it does not fully comply with the ERC1155 standard, so we say that Hats are ERC1155-similar tokens.

Therefore it is wrong that the `supportsInterface` function returns `true` for ERC1155.

## Impact
Any components interacting with the `Hats` contract can misbehave by relying on `Hats` to correctly implement ERC1155.

Of course if another contract is explicitly programmed to interact with `Hats` it can know that `Hats` is not ERC1155 compliant.

The ERC165 standard however allows other contracts to interact seamlessly with any contracts based on the interfaces they support based on the `supportsInterface` function. In such a case the wrongly implemented `supportsInterface` function can cause misbehavior.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
The `Hats` contract should override the `supportsInterface` function. This new function should return `true` only for ERC165 and ERC1155MetadataURI.
