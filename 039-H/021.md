# createHat can be called by indirect admins

## Summary
The Hats protocol docs specifies that ````createHat```` should be called by a wearer of ````_admin```` hat.

*Creates a new hat. The msg.sender must wear the _admin hat.*

However, the implementation of ````createHat```` only checks if the ````msg.sender```` is an admin of the newly created hat, which is not necessarily the direct wearer of ````_admin```` hat.

## Vulnerability Detail

The requirements are also specified in the comment.
```solidity
  /// @notice Creates a new hat. The msg.sender must wear the `_admin` hat.
```

The ````createHat```` code checks the caller by ````_checkAdmin````, which recursively searches up the hat admins.
```solidity
  // to create a hat, you must be wearing one of its admin hats
  _checkAdmin(newHatId);
```

## Impact

Function may not work as expected.

For example, an account which is not eligible for the ````_admin```` hat, may call ````createHat```` if it is wearing any of the upper-level admin hats.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Directly check if the caller is wearing the ````_admin```` hat.
```solidity
-  _checkAdmin(newHatId);

+  if(balanceof(msg.sender, _admin) == 0)
+      revert NotHatWearer();
```
