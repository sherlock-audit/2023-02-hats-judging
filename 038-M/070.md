# Valid signers can be forcibly removed from the safe

## Summary

By calling `removeOwner` or `swapOwner` on the `safe`, signers can remove other valid signers from the safe.

## Vulnerability Detail

The HSG is set up to prevent valid signers from being removed from the the safe. This is evident in the `removeSigner` function where a check is made with `isValidSigner`, reverting if the subject is wearing a signer hat. 
```solidity
    function removeSigner(address _signer) public virtual {
        if (isValidSigner(_signer)) {
            revert StillWearsSignerHat(_signer);
        }

        _removeSigner(_signer);
    }
```
However, a subset of signers can bypass these checks by approving a transaction that calls `removeOwner` or `swapOwner` on the safe.

## Impact

This can have political consequences where, if a group of signers meets the threshold, they can remove opposing voices from voting power, potentially replacing them with more aligned signers.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add additional checks in `checkAfterExecution` that ensures signers we're not removed or swapped.
