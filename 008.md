# Hats.sol: staticcalls can revert by consuming all gas which can cause other functionality to be blocked

## Summary
The `Hats` contract includes multiple functions that use `staticcall`.

Important functionality makes downstream use of `staticcall`.

This includes the `isWearerOfHat`, `isAdminOfHat`, `balanceOf`, `transferHat` functions (Also but less importantly, `viewHat` and `uri`).

So basically any function to interact with a hat.

The issue is that the external functions that are called by `staticcall`s can use up all Gas which causes a revert.

This means that all functions mentioned above are blocked and cannot be executed.

This is most concerning if the hat is `immutable` because it would make that hat inoperable (`toggle` and `eligibility` address cannot be changed in this case).

Instead what should happen if a contract assigned as `toggle` or `eligibility` misbehaves is that execution can continue with the only issue being that `hatStatus` and `hatWearerStatus` cannot be updated.

## Vulnerability Detail
`transferHat` calls `isEligible` which calls `_isEligible` which contains a `staticcall`:

```solidity
    function _isEligible(address _wearer, Hat storage _hat, uint256 _hatId) internal view returns (bool eligible) {
        (bool success, bytes memory returndata) =
            _hat.eligibility.staticcall(abi.encodeWithSignature("getWearerStatus(address,uint256)", _wearer, _hatId));
        ...
```

`balanceOf` calls `isEligible` and `isActive` which also depend on `staticcall`s.

It is the same for the other functions mentioned. If you follow which code they execute you will reach a `staticcall`.

Thereby execution of these important functions can be blocked when a `staticcall` consumes all Gas.

## Impact
The hat can become inoperable because important functionality is blocked (`transferHat`, `balanceOf`).

Also hats on a deeper level (higher level number) become inoperable because for many operations they will check if someone wears an admin hat which will revert.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Make all functions mentioned independent from `staticcall` or provide a Gas limit for the `staticcall`s like so:
```solidity
staticcall.gas(30000)("");
```
