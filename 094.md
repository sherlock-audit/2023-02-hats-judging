# Signers can have a free signature to execute transaction of safe if address(0) if a valid wearer.

## Summary
As sponsor confirmed, **address(0)** can receive hats (when `isEgilible` of **address(0)** is true). The fact is that address(0) can't claim signer because of the conditions in contract `OwnerManageer`.  However, signers can have a free signature (from **address(0)**) to execute safe's action.
## Vulnerability Detail
Function `countValidSignatures` doesn't check if `currentOwner` is address(0).
```solidity=
(v, r, s) = signatureSplit(signatures, i);
    if (v == 0) {
        // If v is 0 then it is a contract signature
        // When handling contract signatures the address of the contract is encoded into r
        currentOwner = address(uint160(uint256(r)));
    } else if (v == 1) {
        // If v is 1 then it is an approved hash
        // When handling approved hashes the address of the approver is encoded into r
        currentOwner = address(uint160(uint256(r)));
    } else if (v > 30) {
        // If v > 30 then default va (27,28) has been adjusted for eth_sign flow
        // To support eth_sign and similar we adjust v and hash the messageHash with the Ethereum message prefix before applying ecrecover
        currentOwner =
            ecrecover(keccak256(abi.encodePacked("\x19Ethereum Signed Message:\n32", dataHash)), v - 4, r, s);
    } else {
        // Default is the ecrecover flow with the provided data hash
        // Use ecrecover with the messageHash for EOA signatures
        currentOwner = ecrecover(dataHash, v, r, s);
    }

    if (isValidSigner(currentOwner)) {
        // shouldn't overflow given reasonable sigCount
        unchecked {
            ++validSigCount;
        }
    }
```
Example if the signature is 0x00..0, then v = 0 and `currentOwner` is **address(0)**.
If **address(0)** is a wearer of the valid hat, the signers can have a free signature easily to execute transaction.
## Impact
Signers can have a free signature

## Tool used
Manual review

## Recommendation
Should not increase `validSigCount` if owner is address(0)
