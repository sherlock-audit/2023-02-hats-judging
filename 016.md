# Missing 0 check in setUp function or missing setter for address

## Summary
The [_setUp()](https://github.com/Hats-Protocol/hats-zodiac/blob/9455cc0957762f5dbbd8e62063d970199109b977/src/HatsSignerGateBase.sol#L78) function is missing a 0 check for the multisig safe address. 
## Vulnerability Detail
In the contract HatsSignerGateBase, there is a function _setUp() to initialize a new instance. It also sets the safe address, the multisig to this instance is attached. The assignement to the variable `safe` is missing a check for the 0 address. You would think there is no problem because `safe` is a mutable variable so it can be changed every time. However there is nowhere else a setter for the variable `safe`.
## Impact
If during the initialization the address is set to the 0 address by accident. The contract would need to be redeployed which costs a lot of extra gas. Because there is no other setter method, it will also be a big problem if they set it to a wrong address by accident.
## Code Snippet
```solidity
    function _setUp(
        uint256 _ownerHatId,
        address _safe,
        address _hats,
        uint256 _minThreshold,
        uint256 _targetThreshold,
        uint256 _maxSigners,
        string memory _version,
        uint256 _existingModuleCount
    ) internal {
        _HatsOwned_init(_ownerHatId, _hats);
        maxSigners = _maxSigners;
        safe = IGnosisSafe(_safe);

        _setTargetThreshold(_targetThreshold);
        _setMinThreshold(_minThreshold);
        version = _version;
        enabledModuleCount = _existingModuleCount + 1; // this contract is enabled as well
    }
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use a 0 check in the `_setUp()` function or create another setter method. The setter method might be the safest approach.
