# `maxSigners` can be exceeded, causing all safe transactions to revert

## Summary

By calling `addOwnerWithThreshold` on the safe, the number valid signers can exceed the `maxSigners` limit set on the HSG.

## Vulnerability Detail

The HSG is set up to where signing hat wearers are to call `claimSigner` to be validated as a signer and added as a safe owner. This process includes a check to ensure that the number of signers does not exceed `maxSigners`.
```solidity
        if (currentSignerCount >= maxSigs) {
            revert MaxSignersReached();
        }
```
However, once the HSG has enough signers to complete transactions, they can call `addOwnerWithThreshold` on the safe to add an additional signing hat wearers, bypassing this check.

## Impact

Once the number of owners wearing signer hats exceeds `maxSigners`, the safe will no longer be able to successfully make transactions as `reconcileSignerCount` will revert with the `MaxSignersReached` error.
```solidity
        uint256 validSignerCount = _countValidSigners(owners);

        if (validSignerCount > maxSigners) {
            revert MaxSignersReached();
        }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Include additional checks in `checkAfterExecution` that ensures additional signers were not added.
