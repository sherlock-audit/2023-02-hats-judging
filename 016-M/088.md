# last Invalid Signer will never be swapped!

## Summary
On claimOwner, one invalid signer should be swapped with new one if signersCount reached maximum. But the loop doesn't iterate last signer.

## Vulnerability Detail
safe.getOwners() return value doesn't include SENTINEL_OWNERS at last, so we should check all items.
But it omits the last element, as the loop iterates until iterator is less than count-1, not count.

## Impact
Last invalid signer will never be swapped.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
bytes memory data;

for (uint256 i; i < _ownerCount - 1;) {
    ownerToCheck = _owners[i];
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
 - for (uint256 i; i < _ownerCount - 1;) {
 + for (uint256 i; i < _ownerCount;) {
