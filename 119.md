# Hats.sol, function isInGoodStanding may return success for a renounced Hat also

## Summary
In Hats.sol, the view function isInGoodStanding checks whether a wearer of a Hat is in good standing. However there is no check if the wearer is currently wearing the hat.

Step1: An address is assigned/minted a Hat, say wearer-x assigned to hatid-x
Step2: A call to function isInGoodStanding(wearer-x, hatid-x) gives success
Step3: wearer-x renounces the hatid-x, so this address is not wearing the hatid-x any more
Step4: A call to function isInGoodStanding(wearer-x, hatid-x) still gives success

## Vulnerability Detail
If an upstream contract or application uses this function isInGoodStanding, and takes decision to give permissions, etc., then 
its possible for an address previously in good standing to misuse. Hence marking this issue as High.

## Impact
An address earlier having a good standing, but currently not wearer of the hat will be authorized by the Hats protocol

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Check if the wearer is currently having balance > 0, by adding this function isWearerOfHat(address _user, uint256 _hatId) inside isInGoodStanding, otherwise return failure.
