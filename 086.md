# linking of hat trees can freeze hat operations because of gas limit

## Summary
`hats._checkAdmin` function has numerous external function calls. When making this call, the gas consumption may exceed the transaction and block gas limit of 30m, resulting in failure. This is particularly true when the tree has a large number of levels (linked) and external contract call (eligibility) consumes a significant amount of gas.

## Vulnerability Detail
Most of hats functions (like mint, transfer, change details, approve link) check if the msg.sender is admin by calling `_checkAdmin`
1. `_checkAdmin` calls `isWearerOfHat ` for each level of the tree: 
   `// search up _hatId's local address space for an admin hat that the _user wears
        while (adminLocalHatLevel > 0) {
            if (isWearerOfHat(_user, getAdminAtLocalLevel(_hatId, adminLocalHatLevel))) {
                return isAdmin = true;
            }`
2.   `isWearerOfHat` is calling an eligibility contract that can consume a considerable amount of gas.
3.  So the `_checkAdmin `is calling a gas-intensive function multiple times and when the hat tree has lots of levels, it can fail because of the gas limit of a block.
## Impact
top-level admins can't do any operation on lower-level hats when the tree grows too big.
