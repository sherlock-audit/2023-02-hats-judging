# Incompatibility between balanceOf and balanceOfBatch.

## Summary
ERC1155 has a function `balanceOfBatch` not overridden by contract `Hats`. This function is public and does not account for the active/inactive status of a hat or whether the user is eligible; it instead returns the `static balance` of inputed users. 
If a users use this `balanceOfBatch` function for checking the status of hats wearers, they will receive wrong result and make wrong decisions based on that.

## Vulnerability Detail
Here is a POC:
```solidity
contract IncompatibilityBetweenBalanceOfAndBatchBalanceOf is TestSetup {
    function testIncompatibility() public {
        (uint256[] memory ids, address[] memory wearers) = createHatsBranch(3, topHatId, topHatWearer, false);
        // make hat number 2 inactive
        vm.prank(_toggle);
        hats.setHatStatus(ids[2], false);

        uint256 balanceOfResult;
        uint256[] memory balanceOfBatchResult;
        balanceOfResult = hats.balanceOf(wearers[2], ids[2]);
        balanceOfBatchResult = hats.balanceOfBatch(wearers, ids);

        // balance of wearers[2] for ids[2] is returned differently from 2 functions
        assertEq(balanceOfResult, 0);
        assertEq(balanceOfBatchResult[2], 1);
    }
}
``` 
command to test `forge test --match-path test/Hats.t.sol -vvvv --match-contract IncompatibilityBetweenBalanceOfAndBatchBalanceOf`

## Impact
- Incompatibility between `balanceOf` and `balanceOfBatch`
- Wrong results returned to users

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
I recommend overriding function `balanceOfBatch` and return the same result with `balanceOf`
