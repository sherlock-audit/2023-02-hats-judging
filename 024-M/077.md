# [Medium][Outdated State] `_swapSigner` might cause `signerCount` to increase incorrectly

## Summary
`_swapSigner` swaps the first invalid signer with another signer, in case the removed signer was a part of `signerCount` when it was last updated, `signerCount` is incremented incorrectly.

## Vulnerability Detail
Consider the scenario below:

(1) We have 4 owners, owners 0, 1, 3 are valid and 2 is invalid, therefore `signerCount = 3`
(2) 1 misbehaves and becomes invalid
(3) `maxSigners = 4`, so when someone who is wearing a hat calls `claimSigner` the HSG looks to swap an invalid signer out
(4) `_swapSigner` finds that 1 is deactivated now and seeks to replace it
(5) now 0, 1, and 3 are active but `signerCount = 4`
(6) any future claim signer is rejected until `reconcileSignerCount` is called

## Impact
Valid `claimSigner` requests will be denied while they should go through
