# An admin can secure the good standing and eligibility of any hat wear under him easily.

## Summary
An admin Bob can secure the good standing and eligibility of any hat wears under him easily. All he needs to do is just a call ``makeHatImmutable(_hatId)``. If  hat.eligibility = 0, and hat.toggle = 0, then the wear of ``_hatId`` will secure his good standing and eligibility forever. 

The vulnerability lies in: it provides almost equal power to all admins at various levels, as a result, a decision by a lower-level admin, such as the immutability of a node, cannot overruled by a higher-level admin.


## Vulnerability Detail

Consider Alice owns a ``_hatId`` 001 (for simplicity), and Bob is an admin for 001 at any level. Suppose ``hat001.toggle = 0`` and ``hat001.eligibility = 0``. Therefore, ``badStandings[001][Alice]  = false``;

Now Bob can call ``makeHatImmutable(001)`` to make hat001 immutable.

As a result, Alice will be in good standing and eligible for hat001 forever. Bob cannot change that, other admins cannot change that either.

1) Nobody can change the eligibility of hat001:

2) Nobody can change the toggle of hat001:
[https://github.com/Hats-Protocol/hats-protocol/blob/fafcfdf046c0369c1f9e077eacd94a328f9d7af0/src/Hats.sol#L623-L636](https://github.com/Hats-Protocol/hats-protocol/blob/fafcfdf046c0369c1f9e077eacd94a328f9d7af0/src/Hats.sol#L623-L636)

3) isInGoodStanding(Alice, 001) will always return true because ``hat001.eligibility = 0`` ``badStandings[001][Alice]  = false``;

[https://github.com/Hats-Protocol/hats-protocol/blob/fafcfdf046c0369c1f9e077eacd94a328f9d7af0/src/Hats.sol#L939-L963](https://github.com/Hats-Protocol/hats-protocol/blob/fafcfdf046c0369c1f9e077eacd94a328f9d7af0/src/Hats.sol#L939-L963)

4) isEligible(Alice, 001) will always return true because ``hat001.eligibility = 0`` ``badStandings[001][Alice]  = false``;
```javascript
 function isEligible(address _wearer, uint256 _hatId) public view returns (bool eligible) {
        eligible = _isEligible(_wearer, _hats[_hatId], _hatId);
    }
function _isEligible(address _wearer, Hat storage _hat, uint256 _hatId) internal view returns (bool eligible) {
        (bool success, bytes memory returndata) =
            _hat.eligibility.staticcall(abi.encodeWithSignature("getWearerStatus(address,uint256)", _wearer, _hatId));

        /* 
        * if function call succeeds with data of length == 64, then we know the contract exists 
        * and has the getWearerStatus function (which returns two words).
        * But — since function selectors don't include return types — we still can't assume that the return data is two booleans, 
        * so we treat it as a uint so it will always safely decode without throwing.
        */
        if (success && returndata.length == 64) {
            bool standing;
            // check the returndata manually
            (uint256 firstWord, uint256 secondWord) = abi.decode(returndata, (uint256, uint256));
            // returndata is valid
            if (firstWord < 2 && secondWord < 2) {
                standing = (secondWord == 1) ? true : false;
                // never eligible if in bad standing
                eligible = (standing && firstWord == 1) ? true : false;
            }
            // returndata is invalid
            else {
                eligible = !badStandings[_hatId][_wearer];
            }
        } else {
            eligible = !badStandings[_hatId][_wearer];
        }
    }
```

5) The admin cannot invalidate a wearer Alice either by transfer since transfer is disabled for immutable hat.

6) In conclusion, a malicious admin can ensure good standing and eligibility for any of his subordinate forever and any other admin (even higher-level) cannot overrule it. Meanwhile, a subordinate might get help from any admin to secure his good standing and eligibility forever. 


## Impact
Immutability can be abused by an admin to secure a subordinate's good standing and eligibility forever. The same admin and other admins can never reverse that decision.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Record the action/decision made by a lower level admin, and allows a higher-level admin to overrule it, including immutability.
