# Reentrancy in createHat can bypass hat limits (immutable, maxSupply)

## Summary
`_checkAdmin` has the risk of reentrancy exploit since it calls an external contract at the eligibility address.
There are many functions that call it, but `createHat `poses the greatest risk.

## Vulnerability Detail
Suppose that a hacker is an admin and has uploaded a malicious contract (MContract) to the eligibility address:
1. Hacker calls `createHat` with values1 (reasonable settings maxSupply=1, mutable)
2. At this line, an Id (lets call A) is set:         
    `newHatId = getNextId(_admin);`
3. At the next line, MContract is called:
       ` _checkAdmin(newHatId);`
4. MContract calls `hats.createHat` again with values2 (maxSupply=10, immutable)
5. hats contract create the hat with id=A with values2 and return to MContract
6. MContract mints 10 tokens of hat or runs any malicious code (like pretending that the hat is immutable) and returns to hats
7. hats continues the first thread and creates a hat with the same id=A and vaules1

## Impact
Bypass hat limits like mutability and maxSupply when creating a hat

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Check admin before setting the hat id:
```solidity
        _checkAdmin(newHatId);
        newHatId = getNextId(_admin);
```
