# Move tree root to different tree without consent

## Summary

A tree root can be moved to a tree not within its current sub-tree without its explicit consent due to unfortunate ordering of actions.

## Vulnerability Detail

If a topHat `A` is grafted onto a tree with admin `B`, `requestLinkTopHatToTree()` can be called by `B` to request `A` be linked to a totally separate tree via admin `C`. 

`B` or `C` cannot immediately accept the link request to of `A` to `C` since `_linkTopHatToTree()` the function that executes the link checks that if `A` is already linked, `C` must be in the same tree as `B`.

However, if `B` calls `unlinkTopHatFromTree()` to be removed from the tree of `B`, `C` can immediately call `approveLinkTopHatToTree()` to link `A` to `C`.

## Impact

If a hat calls `unlinkTopHatFromTree()`, to remove one of its branch, other branch admins can sandwich the call with `requestLinkTopHatToTree()` and `approveLinkTopHatToTree()` to link it back to itself or to another tree with the help of another tree admin.

Note that this is described under the assumption that `unlinkTopHatFromTree()` is called by admins of `A` which is untrue to docs but is the case in the code as I'll describe in another issue. The issue is still relevant if`unlinkTopHatFromTree()` can only be called by `A`.

## Code Snippet

No check of cross tree grafting in requestLinkTopHatToTree:

Check of cross tree grafting is done here:

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Delete pending requests when ungrafting.

```diff
    function unlinkTopHatFromTree(uint32 _topHatDomain) external {
        uint256 fullTopHatId = uint256(_topHatDomain) << 224; // (256 - TOPHAT_ADDRESS_SPACE);
        _checkAdmin(fullTopHatId);  // @audit wrong check?

        delete linkedTreeAdmins[_topHatDomain];
+       delete linkedTreeRequests[_topHatDomain];
        emit TopHatLinked(_topHatDomain, 0);
    }
```
