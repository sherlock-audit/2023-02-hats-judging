# _guardEntries not protecting against re-entry

## Summary

Safe users can forge a transaction to call `checkTransaction()` from within the safe, which will increase the value of `_guardEntries` by 1, rendering the underflow check in `checkAfterExecution()` useless.

## Vulnerability Detail

The safe users can forge valid data and signatures for a valid safe transaction with `currentNonce + 1`, and use this data to make a valid safe transaction with `currentNonce` that executes this data.

The execution will go through `checkTransaction()` before execution, bumping `_guardEntries` to 1. It will then execute itself, entering `checkTransaction()` once again, bumping `_guardEntries` to 2.

After the transaction is executed, `checkAfterExecution()` will lower `_guardEntries` back to 1 and leave it at 1.

The transaction execution coming from the safe, the protective measure `if (msg.sender != address(safe)) revert NotCalledFromSafe()` is useless.

## Impact

The `_guardEntries` value can be bumped to `1` by safe users. I am not sure why the protocol wants to prevent re-entry using this value on these functions, but if it is important to the protocol, it should know it does not work.

## Code Snippet

checkTransaction bumps `_guardEntries`:

checkAfterExecution lowers `_guardEntries` expecting to catch re-entry by having underflow errors:

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Check that the value of `_guardEntries` is 1 before lowering it and revert if it is not.
