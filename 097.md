# Hat wearers who are not the safe's owners can execute safe's transaction

## Summary
In contract `HatsSignerGateBase.sol`, function `countValidSignatures` is used to count number of valid signers from the signatures. Because of `maxSigners`, the valid hat wearers can be unable to claim signer permission to be safe's owners. However, these wearers who are not the safe's owners can be counted in `countValidSignatures`, and they can execute safe's transaction.
## Vulnerability Detail
Function `countValidSignatures` always increases `validSigCount` if `currentOwner` is a valid wearer, even this address is not the one of safe's owners.
```solidity=
//function `countValidSignatures`, contract `HatsSignerGateBase.sol`
if (isValidSigner(currentOwner)) {
    // shouldn't overflow given reasonable sigCount
    unchecked {
        ++validSigCount;
    }
}
```
* `isValidSigner` in contract `HatsSignerGate`:
```solidity=
function isValidSigner(address _account) public view override returns (bool valid) {
    valid = HATS.isWearerOfHat(_account, signersHatId);
}
```
* `isValidSigner` in contract `MultiHatsSignerGate`:
```solidity=
function isValidSigner(address _account) public view override returns (bool valid) {
    /// @dev existing `claimedSignerHats` are always valid, since `validSignerHats` is append-only
    valid = HATS.isWearerOfHat(_account, claimedSignerHats[_account]);
}
```
Therefore, the wearers of specific hats who are not the safe's owners still can execute the safe's transaction.
Example, there are 20 wearers have the same hat, but only 10 of them are safe's owners (`maxSigner` = 10). However, the other 10 wearers (who are not safe's owners) can execute safe's transaction.

## Impact
Valid hat wearers who are not the safe's owners can execute safe's transaction

## Tool used
Manual review

## Recommendation
Add the check to confirm the signer from signatures is safe's owner in function `countValidSignatures`:
```solidity=
if (isValidSigner(currentOwner) && safe.isOwner(currentOwner)) {
    // shouldn't overflow given reasonable sigCount
    unchecked {
        ++validSigCount;
    }
}
```
