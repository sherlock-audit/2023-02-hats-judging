# Hats.uri function can be DOSed by providing large details or imageURI string or cause large gas fees

## Summary
The [`Hats.uri`](https://github.com/Hats-Protocol/hats-protocol/blob/fafcfdf046c0369c1f9e077eacd94a328f9d7af0/src/Hats.sol#L1221-L1223) function returns a JSON representation of a hat's properties.

The issue is that the length of the `details` and `imageURI` string can be so big that the function consumes more than the maximum amount of gas. This would cause the transaction to revert.

Also a malicious user can just make the length so big that the transaction becomes very expensive. This would cause unnecessary expenses to anyone calling the function which is basically a loss of funds.

## Vulnerability Detail
The attack is only feasible on a low cost chain (so not on the ETH mainnet) because the attacker needs to set the large string which costs a lot of gas.

So let us consider Polygon which has a block gas limit of 30 million gas.

Furthermore I used this site to calculate the gas costs for the Polygon Network: https://www.cryptoneur.xyz/gas-fees-calculator

So in order to DOS the `Hats.uri` function we must make it consume `>30m` Gas.

It is not possible to set the `details` field to such a large string directly within one transaction because it would cost `>30m` Gas.

So we need to slowly increase the length of the `details` field using the `Hats.changeHatDetails` function.

Increasing the length by so much that the `Hats.uri` function consumes an extra `1m` Gas costs at most `15m` Gas (I tested this but obviously I cannot paste the code here because it would be ridiculously big).

At most we would have to spend `30 * 15m = 450m` Gas to execute the attack.

Using the calculator I linked, this costs `~92 USD` at the time of writing this.

This is within reach of an attacker. Also we must consider that gas prices may drop in the future.

## Impact
So the attacker can DOS the `Hats.uri` function or cause anyone calling it to spend up to `30m` Gas which is `~6 USD` on Polygon.

Also the attacker can make the hat immutable after performing the attack such that the string cannot be changed anymore.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Introduce a reasonable limit for the length of the `details` and `imageURI` field.
