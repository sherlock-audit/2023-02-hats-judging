# The `claimSigner()` function would be blocked.

## Summary

`claimSigner()` would be blocked because of an inconsistency of `signerCount` and `_countValidSigners(owners)`.

## Vulnerability Detail

Suppose a DAO has a Safe that all owners have worn a signer hat:
* Safe owners: 10
* maxSigners: 10
* currentSignerCount (aka `signerCount`): 10
* validSignerCount (aka `_countValidSigners()`): 10

Alice has a signer hat, but she isn't an owner. If Bob is the owner and he burns the token:
* Safe owners: 10
* maxSigners: 10
* currentSignerCount (aka `signerCount`): 10
* validSignerCount (aka `_countValidSigners()`): 9

Ideally, Alice should be able to claim as a signer, but the `claimSigner()` would be blocked because `currentSignerCount >= maxSigs` and she will get `MaxSignersReached` error.

The solution is that users should call `reconcileSignerCount()` to update `signerCount` before calling `claimSigner()`. But the solution would result in bad UX, that users don't know they should call `reconcileSignerCount()` first and get confused.

On the other hand, it's possible that `reconcileSignerCount()` may be blocked. See more details in GimelSec issue `reconcileSignerCount() would be blocked if validSignerCount > maxSigners, Safe would not be able to execute any transactions, all assets would be locked`.

## Impact

The `claimSigner()` function would be blocked.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Do not use the stale `signerCount` variable, always use `getSignerCount()` to dynamically get the current signer count by `_countValidSigners(safe.getOwners())`.
