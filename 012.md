# `MultiHatsSignerGate` allows addition but not removal of signer hats

## Summary
The contract `MultiHatsSignerGate` allows the batch addition of signer hats. However, there is no function to remove them
## Vulnerability Detail
The contract allows the owner to specify an array of hats during initialization, in the `setUp` function which can be called only once. The contract also has a second function `addSignerHats` which allows the addition of hats at a later time. Since the contract shows intent to modify the list after deployment/initialization, it should also have a function to remove hats from the array if needed.
This can address issues like a DAO splitting up, or a particular team (hatId) switching from one sub-group to another, which requires the admin to be able to revoke the access to the first sub-group.
## Impact
One-sided control over allowed signer hats
