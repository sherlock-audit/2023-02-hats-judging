# Can get around hats per level constraints using phantom levels

## Summary

Each hat has the ability to mint `2^16 = 65,536` direct children. The id of the next child to be minted is saved in `_hats[_admin].lastHatId` and is incremented with each new child created. Once it hits 65,536, no more children can be created, as specified in the comments:

> // use the overflow check to constrain to correct number of hats per level

However, this check can be bypassed by using phantom levels. The basic idea is that there is nothing stopping an admin from creating a new hat and setting the admin to a non-existent path, using intermediate hatIds of 0 to accomplish this.

## Vulnerability Detail

Here's an example to make it more concrete:
- I am a topHat with domain 0x00000001
- I have created all 65,536 possible children (0x1.0001 to 0x1.ffff)
- But nothing is stopping me from setting 0x1.0000.0001 as the admin and continuing to create hats
- This hatId cannot possible exist (because no hatId immediately following a `0000` can actually be minted)
- Therefore, it is functionally the same as having 0x1 as the only admin
- This user can then continue to create children from 0x1.0000.0001.0001 to 0x1.0000.0001.ffff
- This can be repeated at each level, creating the ability to have unlimited direct children

## Impact

The constraints around the number of direct descendants that an individual hat can have can be easily violated.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add logic in `isAdminOfHat()` to ensure that each hat along the path being checked has a `maxSupply > 0` and is therefore a real hat.
