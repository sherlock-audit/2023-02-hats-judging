# Minting inactive hats

## Summary

Inactive hats can still be minted by admins.

## Vulnerability Detail

There is no check in `mintHat()` about the status of a hat before it is minted.

## Impact

Protocol users may assume that inactive hats cannot be minted so that if they deactivate a hat and activate it again the number and identity of wearers would not change in between the two events, while it may.

## Recommendation

Prevent hat minting when inactive.
