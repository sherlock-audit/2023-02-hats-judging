# Inconsistency of expected behavior when address is ineligible and good standing

## Summary
There is inconsistency in the protocol's expected behaviour or desirable outcome when an address is ineligible and good standing.

Refer Documenation : https://github.com/Hats-Protocol/hats-protocol/blob/fafcfdf046c0369c1f9e077eacd94a328f9d7af0/README.md#eligibility

Wearer Eligibility (A) mentions that If an address "Currently wears the Hat" and is "Not Eligible", then "The Hat is revoked".

Wearer Standing (B)  mentions that "...; it is possible for an address may be ineligible but in good standing."


## Vulnerability Detail
If an address is made ineligible but in good standing, then anyone can call checkHatWearerStatus() and revoke the Hat, making the use case void.

## Impact
There will be confusion in the use case where the wearer is ineligible but in good standing.

## Code Snippet

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

If the protocol desires that it should be "possible for an address may be ineligible but in good standing", then the "Hat should Not be revoked".
In function _processHatWearerStatus, call _burnHat, only if the standing is bad.
