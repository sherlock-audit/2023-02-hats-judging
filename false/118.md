# Owners can be swapped even though they still wear their signer hats

## Summary

`HatsSignerGateBase` does not check for a change of owners post-flight. This allows a group of actors to collude and replace opposing signers with cooperating signers, even though the replaced signers still wear their signer hats.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `HatsSignerGateBase` performs various checks to prevent a multisig transaction to tamper with certain variables. Something that is currently not checked for in `checkAfterExecution` is a change of owners. A colluding group of malicious signers could abuse this to perform swaps of safe owners by using a delegate call to a corresponding malicious contract. This would bypass the requirement of only being able to replace an owner if he does not wear his signer hat anymore as used in `_swapSigner`:

```js
for (uint256 i; i < _ownerCount - 1;) {
    ownerToCheck = _owners[i];

    if (!isValidSigner(ownerToCheck)) {
        // prep the swap
        data = abi.encodeWithSignature(
            "swapOwner(address,address,address)",
            ...
```

## Impact

bypass restrictions and perform action that should be disallowed.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Perform a pre- and post-flight comparison on the safe owners, analogous to what is currently done with the modules.
