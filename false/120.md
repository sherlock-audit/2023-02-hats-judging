# function reconcileSignerCount() set higher value for safe's threshold which can cause safe's transaction execution to revert always

## Summary
in function `reconcileSignerCount()` a fix has been made for the last audit issue but the fix is not valid and there is a bug in it. code always set the value of the `validSignerCount` for the safe's threshold instead of the `newThreshold`. in some cases code would set threshold value for the safe higher than target value in the HSG.

## Vulnerability Detail
This is `reconcileSignerCount()` code:
```solidity
    function reconcileSignerCount() public {
        address[] memory owners = safe.getOwners();
        uint256 validSignerCount = _countValidSigners(owners);

        if (validSignerCount > maxSigners) {
            revert MaxSignersReached();
        }

        // update the signer count accordingly
        signerCount = validSignerCount;

        uint256 currentThreshold = safe.getThreshold();
        uint256 newThreshold;
        uint256 target = targetThreshold; // save SLOADs

        if (validSignerCount <= target && validSignerCount != currentThreshold) {
            newThreshold = validSignerCount;
        } else if (validSignerCount > target && currentThreshold < target) {
            newThreshold = target;
        }
        if (newThreshold > 0) {
            bytes memory data = abi.encodeWithSignature("changeThreshold(uint256)", validSignerCount);

            bool success = safe.execTransactionFromModule(
                address(safe), // to
                0, // value
                data, // data
                Enum.Operation.Call // operation
            );

            if (!success) {
                revert FailedExecChangeThreshold();
            }
        }
    }
```
As you can see in the line `data = abi.encodeWithSignature("changeThreshold(uint256)", validSignerCount)` code set the value of the `validSignerCount` as safe's new threshold and this value can be bigger than `targetThreshold` in the HSG contract. so safe would have wrong threshold and some transactions won't get executed because they don't have enough signature even so they have `targetThreshold` valid signature.

## Impact
some transactions won't get executed in the safe because threshold set as very high value by mistake. also all transactions with high signature count would fail because of the return value of `_getCorrectThreshold()` would be `targetThreshold` as max but reconcile would make safe's threshold to be higher than target value and the checks in `checkAfterExecution()` would always fail and executing transactions would revert always in safe.
