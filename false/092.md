# topHat admin can lose its token and there is no backup to recover

## Summary
If a topHat admin mistakenly `renounceHat()`, or transfer the token to a mistaken address (like address(0)) **there is no way** to recover the hat.
There is no other token (maxSupply=1) or other admin to mint a new token. 
As a result:
High level control of the DAO will be lost.
- They can not mint, transfer or edit level-1 hats
- They can not link the tree to other admins.

## Vulnerability Detail
TopHat is the most important hat in a DAO and losing it means losing top-level control and the next level hats cant be changed.
A topHat admin can renounce the hat by calling `renounceHat` :
`function renounceHat(uint256 _hatId) external {
        if (_staticBalanceOf(msg.sender, _hatId) < 1) {
            revert NotHatWearer();
        }
        // remove the hat
        _burnHat(msg.sender, _hatId);
    }`

## Impact
Losing control of DAO and level-1 admins

Manual Review

## Recommendation
topHat admins OR topHat admins that have any admin at the lower level
should not be able to renounce their hat or transfer it to zero address.
