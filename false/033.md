# Owners of linkedin tophats cannot have eligibility revoked

## Summary

Tophats that are linked to new admins are supposed to behave like normal hats, rather than tophats, but their `eligibility` variable will be permanently set to `address(0)`. This turns off the `badStanding` functionality, which allows all owners of the hat to be immune to punishments from their admins.

## Vulnerability Detail

When a Tophat is linked to a new admin, the assumption is that it will behave like any other immutable hat. From the docs:

> a tophat that has been linked (aka grafted) onto another hat tree is no longer considered a tophat

However, while most hats are not able to have their `toggle` or `eligibility` set to the zero address (which is carefully checked against in `createHat()`), tophats will always have them set to the zero address.

Since these hats are immutable, even when they are linked, there is no way to change the values of these two variables. They are permanently set to `address(0)`.

This is especially problematic for `eligibility`, as even the local value of `badStandings` that can be used if the event that there is no external contract is set in `_processHatWearerStatus()`, which can only be called if `eligibility` is either an EOA that calls `setHatWearerStatus()` or a contract that implements the `IHatsEligibility` interface.

This causes major problems for admins of linked tophats, as while they are expected to behave like other immutable hats, instead will not give the admin the privileges they need.

## Impact

Admins controlling linked tophats cannot turn off the eligibility of wearers who misbehave, giving tophat owners extra power and breaking the principle that linked tophats are no longer considered tophats.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Create the ability for linked tophats to change their `toggle` and `eligibility` addresses one time upon being linked. This could be accomplished with an extra bit value in the `config` storage, which could be set and unset when tophats are linked and unlinked.
