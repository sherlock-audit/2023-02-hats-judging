# [Low][Flow] `deployHatsSignerGate` does not check if the safe is connected to another HSG

Disclaimer: I want to label this "Low" but the labels in sherlock's repo are not correctly set and there is no Low or Informational label available.

## Summary
When creating HSG and connecting it to an existing safe, it is important to check the connection of the safe to another existing HSG. 

## Vulnerability Detail
Since factory does not track the creation instances, it is not possible to check if the safe is connected to another HSG, is HSG is connected to such safe, many inconsistencies can happen and cause the safe to fail.

## Impact
N to 1 relations between HSGs and safe are not provided and can lead to inconsistencies.
