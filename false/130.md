# Increase the number of valid signers past maxSigners

## Summary

The number of valid signers can be increased past maxSigners if users are added, their hats are toggled of so they are considered invalid signers, new signers are added reaching the `maxSigners` limit, and the hats of the previously inactive signers are toggled back on.

## Vulnerability Detail

`reconcileSignerCount()` does not remove inactive owners from the underlying safe, it simply updates the threshold and the `signerCount` value. 

New users can be added with respect to the `maxSigners` constraint after signers have been made invalid by toggling their hats off and calling `reconcileSignerCount()`.

Once the hats of the inactive users are turned back on, the number of valid signers on the underlying safe will go above `maxSigners` and checks like `if (currentSignerCount >= maxSigs) { revert ... }` will revert.

## Impact

The number of signers on the underlying safe may go above limits resulting in failing safe transaction / `reconcileSignerCount()` due to maxSigs checks.
