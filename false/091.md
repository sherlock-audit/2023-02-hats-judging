# Can't deploy HSG and Safe anymore in Factory

## Summary
To imitate _deployHatsSignerGate, Attacker can call moduleProxyFactory.deployModule directly with nonce specified, resulting the contract is created on calculated address with nonce being not increased. Later deploys from Factory will fail and Admin can't deploy HSG anymore.

## Vulnerability Detail
To avoide frontrunning, HatsSignerGateFactory._deployHatsSignerGate introduced ever-increasing nonce. But anyone(attacker) can create module by calling moduleProxyFactory.deployModule directly with exactly same parameters and current nonce value. That creates contract in correct address. So far, it's good, as attacked 'helped' creating HSG. But the problem is that nonce is not increased, so latter calls to deployHatsSignerGateAndSafe fails contract creation and revert TakenAddress(0) error.

## Impact
Admin can't deploy HSG and Safe anymore with one Factory.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/Hats-Protocol/hats-zodiac/blob/main/src/HatsSignerGateFactory.sol#L143-L169
```solidity
hsg = moduleProxyFactory.deployModule(
    hatsSignerGateSingleton, abi.encodeWithSignature("setUp(bytes)", initializeParams), ++nonce
);
```

```solidity
  function testDeployHatsSignerGate() public {
      ownerHat = uint256(1);
      signerHat = uint256(2);
      minThreshold = 2;
      targetThreshold = 2;
      maxSigners = 5;

      // deploy a safe
      initSafeOwners[0] = address(this);
      safe = deploySafe(initSafeOwners, 1);

      // Imitate deployHSG
      bytes memory initializeParams = abi.encode(
          ownerHat,
          signerHat,
          address(safe),
          HATS,
          minThreshold,
          targetThreshold,
          maxSigners,
          version,
          0
      );

      address hsg = moduleProxyFactory.deployModule(
          address(singletonHatsSignerGate), abi.encodeWithSignature("setUp(bytes)", initializeParams), 1
      );
      console2.log("hsg: ", hsg);

      // Normal Way, which will fail
      hatsSignerGate = HatsSignerGate(
          factory.deployHatsSignerGate(ownerHat, signerHat, address(safe), minThreshold, targetThreshold, maxSigners)
      );
      console2.log("Can't reach me. :(");


      assertEq(safe.getOwners()[0], address(this));

      assertEq(hatsSignerGate.minThreshold(), minThreshold);
      assertEq(hatsSignerGate.ownerHat(), ownerHat);
      assertEq(hatsSignerGate.getHatsContract(), HATS);
      assertEq(hatsSignerGate.targetThreshold(), targetThreshold);
      assertEq(address(hatsSignerGate.safe()), address(safe));
      assertEq(hatsSignerGate.maxSigners(), maxSigners);
      assertEq(hatsSignerGate.version(), version);
  }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Find a way to calculate random salt inside the _deployHatsSignerGate function.
Like using Offchain Oracle.
