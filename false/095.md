# A malicious admin can batch create hats and freeze its hat

## Summary
In each level, there are only a limited number of hats (16 bits). 
If an admin creates all of them as mutable hats in a batch request, the next levels will be frozen.
 
## Vulnerability Detail
A malicious admin can `batchCreateHats()` all the (immutable)hats at the next levels.
As a result, no one can change them or create a new hat at those levels.

## Impact
The admin hat and all the hats under that will be frozen and useless.
