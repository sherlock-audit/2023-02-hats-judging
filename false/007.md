# Initializer modifier on constructor

## Summary
The constructor in [HatsSignerGateBase.sol](https://github.com/Hats-Protocol/hats-zodiac/blob/9455cc0957762f5dbbd8e62063d970199109b977/src/HatsSignerGateBase.sol#L49-L51) has the initializer modifier.
## Vulnerability Detail
A constructor is a special peace of code that is executed once when a contract is created. An initializer modifier is completely unnecessary and highly impractical here. The initializer modifier is used for initialize functions in proxy contracts.
## Impact
No big impact
## Code Snippet
```solidity
    constructor() payable initializer {
        _HatsOwned_init(1, address(0x1));
    }
```
## Tool used

## Recommendation
Remove the modifier because it has no impact
