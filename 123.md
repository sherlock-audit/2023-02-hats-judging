# "HATS" variable defined nowhere

## Summary
The variable "HATS" which occurs in  MultiHatsSignerGate.sol  twice and in  HatsSignerGate.sol  once seems to be defined nowhere.

## Vulnerability Detail
Honestly I'm running out of time now, because the contest will end in a few minutes. But I’ve sincerely checked multiple times. There’s no definition of "HATS" to be found anywhere within the project. I spontaneously believe "HATS" could be a struct.

My apologies in advance if I might have overlooked something.

## Impact
As said, I’m running out of time. So I have no time left to figure out the concrete impact. But I thought I’ll report it nevertheless. I’ll label it as medium severity, though it could easily be a high.

## Recommendation
Define the variable. And figure out why all of your tests passed nevertheless.
