# changeHaxMaxSupply() function implementation is different and misleading from its documentation

## Summary
changeHaxMaxSupply() function implementation is different and misleading from its documentation

## Vulnerability Detail
![hats1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10962355/222952126-815066fc-f41f-4cd0-a01a-a0f81f122f39.png)

The documentation above clearly says that the new max supply cannot be greater than the current supply, but in the function implementation the opposite is being done, because the function clearly reverts at `if (_newMaxSupply < hat.supply)`, so the only way the function call succeeds is if `_newMaxSupply` exceeds `hat.supply`.

## Impact
This is confusing and leads to inconsistency as to what the correct behavior of the function should be

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Modify the function to be consistent with the docs or the docs to be consistent with the function
