# Missing 0 address check in _mintHat

## Summary
The function [_mintHat](https://github.com/Hats-Protocol/hats-protocol/blob/fafcfdf046c0369c1f9e077eacd94a328f9d7af0/src/Hats.sol#L1168-L1179) is missing a check for the 0 address.
## Vulnerability Detail
The internal function `_mintHat()` is used in `mintTopHat()` and `mintHat()`. It also doesn't have any check for the 0 address. If there is no check, they admin might accidently mint to the 0 address. The `mintHat()` function checks for eligibility but because the 0 address has no badStandings it will be eligible.
## Impact
This doesn't seem like a big deal. But imagine a hat with a max supply of 3. The admin can send 2 correct ones to users. When the admin accidently sends the 3rd hat to the 0 address, the supply of the hat will be 3 and equal to the max supply. There is no possibility for the admin to send the 3rd hat to the correct user anymore.
## Code Snippet
```solidity
    function _mintHat(address _wearer, uint256 _hatId) internal {
        unchecked {
            // should not overflow since `mintHat` enforces max balance of 1
            _balanceOf[_wearer][_hatId] = 1;

            // increment Hat supply counter
            // should not overflow given AllHatsWorn check in `mintHat`
            ++_hats[_hatId].supply;
        }
        emit TransferSingle(msg.sender, address(0), _wearer, _hatId, 1);
    }
```
```diff
    function testWearerCanApproveLinkToLastLevelHat() public {
        // mint last level hat to wearer
        vm.prank(topHatWearer);
-       hats.mintHat(level14HatId, fourthWearer);
+       hats.mintHat(level14HatId, zeroAddress);
+       console.log("Balance: ", hats.balanceOf(zeroAddress, level14HatId));

        // request
        vm.prank(thirdWearer);
        hats.requestLinkTopHatToTree(secondTopHatDomain, level14HatId);

        // approve
        vm.prank(fourthWearer);

        vm.expectEmit(true, true, true, true);
        emit TopHatLinked(secondTopHatDomain, level14HatId);

        hats.approveLinkTopHatToTree(secondTopHatDomain, level14HatId);

        assertFalse(hats.isTopHat(secondTopHatId));
        assertEq(hats.getHatLevel(secondTopHatId), 15);
        assertTrue(hats.isAdminOfHat(fourthWearer, secondTopHatId));
        assertEq(hats.linkedTreeRequests(secondTopHatDomain), 0);
    }
```
The following changes in the test indeed shows that the balance of 0 address now 1 is, and shows that it's possible to mint to the 0 address.
Log: Balance:  1

Foundry testing
## Recommendation
Add a zero address check in the `_mintHat()` function.
