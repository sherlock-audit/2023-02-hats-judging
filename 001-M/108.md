# An inconsistency in the behaviour of `balanceOf()` and `balanceOfBatch()`.

## Summary

`balanceOf()` checks `_isActive()` and `_isEligible()`, but `balanceOfBatch()` returns static `_balanceOf` directly.

## Vulnerability Detail

The hats protocol overrides `balanceOf()` to checks `_isActive()` and `_isEligible()`, but it doesn't override `balanceOfBatch()`. The `balanceOfBatch()` returns static `_balanceOf` directly:

```solidity
    function balanceOfBatch(address[] calldata owners, uint256[] calldata ids)
        public
        view
        virtual
        returns (uint256[] memory balances)
    {
        require(owners.length == ids.length, "LENGTH_MISMATCH");

        balances = new uint256[](owners.length);

        // Unchecked because the only math done is incrementing
        // the array index counter which cannot possibly overflow.
        unchecked {
            for (uint256 i = 0; i < owners.length; ++i) {
                balances[i] = _balanceOf[owners[i]][ids[i]];
            }
        }
    }
```

## Impact

It's inconsistency in the behaviour of `balanceOf()` and `balanceOfBatch()`.
It would fail if someone creates a new version of singer gates and misuses `balanceOfBatch()`. Also, some protocols will be broken if a third party protocol integrates the Hats protocol with `balanceOfBatch()`.

## Recommendation

Override `balanceOfBatch()` and check `_isActive()` and `_isEligible()`.
