# The value of signerCount can be broken

## Summary

`_swapSigner()` of `HatsSignerGateBase` increments `signerCount` after a successful swap of previously invalid user. This increment should only be done if the previous value of `signerCount` was correct, i.e. `reconcileSignerCount` was called prior. But the surrounding check does not enforce it.

## Vulnerability Detail

`claimSigner()` of `HatsSignerGate` or `MultiHatsSignerGate` will call `_swapSigner` if `safe.getOwners().length >= maxSigners`. 

Knowing `reconcileSignerCount()` does not remove invalid safe owners, it could be that the safe has more owners than the number of maxSigners.

`_swapSigner()` will successfully replace an invalid signer of the underlying safe with the new signer if there is one. It will then check `if (signerCount < maxSigners)` and increment `signerCount` if so. If `reconcileSignerCount()` has not been called beforehand, the value of `signerCount` could be outdated compared to the actual value of safe owners that are valid signers.

## Impact

We increase the value of signerCount when we should not have, possibly resulting in a number of valid signers above the maxSigners value.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Call `reconcileSignerCount` at the beginning of `claimSigner()`
