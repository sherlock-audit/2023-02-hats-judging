# [Medium][Outdated State] `setThreshold` functions are not using an updated `SignerCount` and might set the threshold on safe incorrectly

## Summary
functions `setTargetThreshold` and `_setSafeThreshold` are using the storage slot `signerCount` to access the number of signers on safe. However, `signerCount` can be outdated and cause the safe threshold to be set incorrectly.

## Vulnerability Detail
function `setTargetThreshold` is using the `signerCount` as below:
```solidity
if (signerCount > 1) _setSafeThreshold(_targetThreshold);
```
and `_setSafeThreshold` is using the `signerCount` value as:
```solidity
        if (signerCount_ <= _threshold) {
            newThreshold = signerCount_;
        }
```
Both of these instances are using the value that last was fetched from the safe when `reconcileSignerCount` was called, however, the value might have changed from then.

(1) `targetThreshold` is set to 6
(2) `reconcileSignerCount` is called and `signerCount` is set to 5
(3) Three new signers have joined the valid signers by calling `claimSigner`
(4) The owner changes the `targetThreshold` to 7
(5) HSG sets the `safeThreshold` to 5 since it still stores 5 as `signerCount` while it should set it to 7 as there are 8 signers currently in the system

The `safeThreshold` should stay outdated until `reconcileSignerCount` is called.

## Impact
Safe can be set to the incorrect threshold.

## Recommendation
`setThreshold` functions should do the calculations with `countValidSigners`
