# Wrong if check for wearer of hat

## Summary
[Hats.sol#L546-L549](https://github.com/Hats-Protocol/hats-protocol/blob/fafcfdf046c0369c1f9e077eacd94a328f9d7af0/src/Hats.sol#L546-L549), the if check uses _staticBalanceOf because admins may want to transfer revoked hats to new wearers as stated in the comment above. But when a hat is revoked, it's burned so it will always be zero.
## Vulnerability Detail
When an admin has the intention to transfer a revoked hat it's not possible because the hat is burned.
## Impact
No big impact
## Code Snippet
```solidity
        // Checks storage instead of `isWearerOfHat` since admins may want to transfer revoked Hats to new wearers
        if (_staticBalanceOf(_from, _hatId) < 1) {
            revert NotHatWearer();
        }
```
