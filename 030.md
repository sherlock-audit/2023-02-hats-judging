# HatsSignerGateBase will not allow tx, that decrease owners count(some wearers are not eligible to wear hat)

## Summary
HatsSignerGateBase will not allow tx, that decrease owners count(some wearers are not eligible to wear hat), because of threshold check in the checkAfterExecution function.
## Vulnerability Detail
HatsSignerGateBase.checkAfterExecution is trying to check if tx has changed `threshold` of Safe.
https://github.com/Hats-Protocol/hats-zodiac/blob/9455cc0957762f5dbbd8e62063d970199109b977/src/HatsSignerGateBase.sol#L507-L529
```solidity
    function checkAfterExecution(bytes32, bool) external override {
        if (msg.sender != address(safe)) revert NotCalledFromSafe();


        if (
            abi.decode(StorageAccessible(address(safe)).getStorageAt(uint256(GUARD_STORAGE_SLOT), 1), (address))
                != address(this)
        ) {
            revert CannotDisableThisGuard(address(this));
        }


        if (safe.getThreshold() != _getCorrectThreshold()) {
            revert SignersCannotChangeThreshold();
        }


        // SENTINEL_OWNERS and SENTINEL_MODULES are both address(0x1)
        (address[] memory modules,) = safe.getModulesPaginated(SENTINEL_OWNERS, enabledModuleCount + 1);
        if (keccak256(abi.encode(modules)) != _existingModulesHash) {
            revert SignersCannotChangeModules();
        }


        // leave checked to catch underflows triggered by re-erntry attempts
        --_guardEntries;
    }
```
In case if `safe.getThreshold() != _getCorrectThreshold()` then tx will revert as contract thinks, that signers has changed threshold.
https://github.com/Hats-Protocol/hats-zodiac/blob/9455cc0957762f5dbbd8e62063d970199109b977/src/HatsSignerGateBase.sol#L533-L540
```solidity
    function _getCorrectThreshold() internal view returns (uint256 _threshold) {
        uint256 count = _countValidSigners(safe.getOwners());
        uint256 min = minThreshold;
        uint256 max = targetThreshold;
        if (count < min) _threshold = min;
        else if (count > max) _threshold = max;
        else _threshold = count;
    }
```
Let's see what `_getCorrectThreshold` will return.
First of all, what's interesting is that it checks count of valid owners. And then checks this count to be between minThreshold and targetThreshold range.
This function supposes, that because `checkTransaction` function called [`reconcileSignerCount` function](https://github.com/Hats-Protocol/hats-zodiac/blob/9455cc0957762f5dbbd8e62063d970199109b977/src/HatsSignerGateBase.sol#L464), then valid owners will be same in the `checkAfterExecution` function.

But tx that will be executed by Safe can be related to hat.eligibility(Safe can be `eligibility` address or Safe can call eligibility contract). Suppose that tx, will call `setHatWearerStatus` for one of owners and will disable it. Because of that `_countValidSigners` will get less amount, then safe.Threshold and tx will revert.

Scenario
1.HatsSignerGateBase has targetThreshold as 5 and minThreshold as 3. Safe has 5 valid owners currently and Safe.threshold is 5 as well and owners signed tx which will make one of them ineligible for a hat. 
2.Inside `checkAfterExecution`, function `_getCorrectThreshold` is called which will return 4 as threshold, as 1 owner is not valid anymore. And check `safe.getThreshold() != _getCorrectThreshold()` will fail as safe.getThreshold is 5 currently.
3.As result tx will revert, however signers didn't change any threshold for a safe.
## Impact
Tx that decreases owners count will revert.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
If you need to check that `safe.getThreshold()` wasn;t changed between calls, maybe you need to store this value as you do with existing modules.
