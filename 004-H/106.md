# `checkAfterExecution()` will always be reverted, Safe would not be able to execute any transactions, all assets would be locked.

## Summary

`checkAfterExecution()` will always be reverted, Safe would not be able to execute any transactions, all assets would be locked.

## Vulnerability Detail

In `_getCorrectThreshold()` [L517](https://github.com/Hats-Protocol/hats-zodiac/blob/9455cc0957762f5dbbd8e62063d970199109b977/src/HatsSignerGateBase.sol#L517-L519), if `safe.getThreshold() > targetThreshold`, the `checkAfterExecution()` will always be reverted because `safe.getThreshold() != _getCorrectThreshold()`.

Suppose a DAO has a Safe that all owners have worn a signer hat:
* Safe owners: 10
* We expect `validSignerCount` (aka `_countValidSigners(owners)`) is 10
* safe.getThreshold(): 6

Then we attach a signer gate to Safe, or call `setTargetThreshold()` if the signer gate is attached.
* `setUp()` set `targetThreshold` to 5.

If we call `setTargetThreshold(5)`, the signer gate will not call `_setSafeThreshold()` because `signerCount` is 0 when the signer gate is first attached, which means that the `safe.getThreshold()` will still be 6.

After that, we have:
* targetThreshold: 5
* safe.getThreshold(): 6
* owners: 10
* validSignerCount (aka `_countValidSigners(owners)`): 10
* maxSigners: 10, assume we setup maxSigners to 10

In this scenario, if the Safe executes a transaction, the transaction will always be reverted.
First the Safe calls `checkTransaction()`:
* In `reconcileSignerCount()` [L192](https://github.com/Hats-Protocol/hats-zodiac/blob/9455cc0957762f5dbbd8e62063d970199109b977/src/HatsSignerGateBase.sol#L192), it updates signerCount to 10.
* But it doesn't call `changeThreshold()` because [L200-L202](https://github.com/Hats-Protocol/hats-zodiac/blob/9455cc0957762f5dbbd8e62063d970199109b977/src/HatsSignerGateBase.sol#L200-L202) `validSignerCount > target && currentThreshold < target`, `10 > 5 && 6 < 5` which is false.

After the Safe executed, it calls `checkAfterExecution`:
* `_getCorrectThreshold()` will get 5, because [L538](https://github.com/Hats-Protocol/hats-zodiac/blob/9455cc0957762f5dbbd8e62063d970199109b977/src/HatsSignerGateBase.sol#L538) `count > max`, `10 > 5`

Then in [L517](https://github.com/Hats-Protocol/hats-zodiac/blob/9455cc0957762f5dbbd8e62063d970199109b977/src/HatsSignerGateBase.sol#L517) checks if `safe.getThreshold() != _getCorrectThreshold()`, `6 != 5` which is true, the transaction will be reverted, the `signerCount` will be reverted to 0.

The transaction which is sent from Safe will always be reverted.

It has a solution that someone should call `reconcileSignerCount()` first to update `signerCount` to 10, then the owner could update the Safe threshold correctly by calling `setTargetThreshold(5)` again. But the solution would result in bad UX, that users don't know they should call `reconcileSignerCount()` first and get confused.

On the other hand, if `reconcileSignerCount()` is always reverted, the `signerCount` will always be 0, the owner is unable to set Safe threshold correctly by `setTargetThreshold(5)`.
The situation is possible, for example, the Safe executes a transaction `safe.addOwnerWithThreshold()` to add one more owner, owners.length is 11 and all owners have a signer hat, the `reconcileSignerCount()` will always be reverted due to L187 `validSignerCount > maxSigners`. See more details in GimelSec issue `reconcileSignerCount() would be blocked if validSignerCount > maxSigners, Safe would not be able to execute any transactions, all assets would be locked`.

Another way to update `signerCount` is `claimSigner()`, but in this scenario, `claimSigner()` will calls `_swapSigner()` due to `ownerCount >= maxSigs`, and revert `NoInvalidSignersToReplace` because all owners are valid.

If nobody could update `signerCount` to actual value, the `setTargetThreshold(5)` will not update Safe threshold, the `checkAfterExecution()` will always be reverted.

## Impact

The transaction which is sent from Safe will always be reverted, all assets would be locked.

## Recommendation

To fix the issue: In `reconcileSignerCount()`, gracefully return and always update `signerCount` to `validSignerCount`.

```solidity
    function reconcileSignerCount() public returns (bool success) {
        address[] memory owners = safe.getOwners();
        uint256 validSignerCount = _countValidSigners(owners);

        // always update the signer count accordingly
        signerCount = validSignerCount;

        if (validSignerCount > maxSigners) {
            return false;
        }

        ...
    }
```

It's better to do:
* Update `signerCount` in `setUp()`.
* Ensure `targetThreshold >= safe.getThreshold()` in `setUp()`.
* Don't use `signerCount` in `setTargetThreshold()`, use `_countValidSigners(owners)`.
