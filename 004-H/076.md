# [High][Flow] `reconcileSignerCount` is not updating the safe threshold correctly

## Summary
`reconcileSignerCount` which is one of the most important functions in HSG is not implementing the call to `changeThreshold` correctly.

## Vulnerability Detail
`reconcileSignerCount` is called whenever HSG needs to be synced with the valid signers that are active in the safe contract and are wearing a hat. However, the function call to safe to set the correct threshold, is implemented incorrectly:
```solidity
bytes memory data = abi.encodeWithSignature("changeThreshold(uint256)", validSignerCount);
```
https://github.com/Hats-Protocol/hats-zodiac/blob/9455cc0957762f5dbbd8e62063d970199109b977/src/HatsSignerGateBase.sol#L204

While `newThreshold` holds the correct value for the safe threshold, validSignerCount is passed to the safe which can be more than `targetThreshold` and is not the correct amount. This is probably happened from the changes implemented from the last private audit provided in the description of the project. (TRST-H-5 Minority may be able to call safe operations)

Imagine the scenario below:
(1) There are currently 5 signers, target threshold is set to 7, and the current threshold is 5
(2) The number of signers increase to 9
(3) The threshold of the safe should be set to 7 as it is the target threshold, but it gets set to 9, which is the number of valid signers

## Impact
This can cause the safe threshold to ignore the `targetThreshold` and cause valid number of signatures to be rejected by the system. `reconcileSignerCount` is supposed to be one of the core functions that keeps things updated between safe and HSG, with such a bug, many security assumptions will be broken.

## Recommendation
The diff below should be implemented:
```solidity
@line 204 HatSignerGateBase.sol
- bytes memory data = abi.encodeWithSignature("changeThreshold(uint256)", validSignerCount);
+ bytes memory data = abi.encodeWithSignature("changeThreshold(uint256)", newThreshold);
```
