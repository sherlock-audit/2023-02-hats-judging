# Usage of HSG for existing safe can brick safe

## Summary

The `HatsSignerGateFactory` allows for deployment of HSG / MHSG for existing safes. I believe the intention is to let the user call `enableModule()` and `setGuard()` on the safe after deployme with the HSG / MHSG address. 

This can result in unmatching values of `maxSigners` in the HSG and number of valid signers of the safe. That will prevent further interaction with the safe rendering it unusable.

## Vulnerability Detail

If a safe has 10 owners with valid hats, and a HSG / MHSG is deployed with a value of `maxSigners < 10` and this HSG / MHSG is wired to the safe, the checks for `validSignerCount <= maxSigners` will revert in the HSG. 

These checks are present in `reconcileSignerCount` and `claimSigner`. However `reconcileSignerCount` is a core function that is called by `checkTransaction()`, the pre-flight check on the safe transaction.

## Impact

The safe will not be able to execute any transaction until the number of valid signers is lowered (some hat wearers give up their hats / some hats turns invalid ...)

## Code Snippet

`reconcileSignerCount` checks maxSigners value:

It is called during `checkTransaction`:

The value is set once during setup and not changeable:

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Allow this value to be changed by owner, or have a function that checks the HSG is safe before making it active after it is wired to an existing safe.
