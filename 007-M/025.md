# HatsSignerGateBase.setTargetThreshold should adjust minThreshold

## Summary
HatsSignerGateBase.setTargetThreshold should adjust minThreshold.
## Vulnerability Detail
HatsSignerGateBase contract has `targetThreshold` and `minThreshold` params.
When `minThreshold` is set, then param is checked to be not bigger than `maxSigners` and `targetThreshold`.
https://github.com/Hats-Protocol/hats-zodiac/blob/9455cc0957762f5dbbd8e62063d970199109b977/src/HatsSignerGateBase.sol#L154-L160
```solidity
    function _setMinThreshold(uint256 _minThreshold) internal {
        if (_minThreshold > maxSigners || _minThreshold > targetThreshold) {
            revert InvalidMinThreshold();
        }


        minThreshold = _minThreshold;
    }
```

However there is no any check for `targetThreshold` when this variable is set. This value should not be less than `minThreshold` variable.
https://github.com/Hats-Protocol/hats-zodiac/blob/9455cc0957762f5dbbd8e62063d970199109b977/src/HatsSignerGateBase.sol#L108-L114
```solidity
    function _setTargetThreshold(uint256 _targetThreshold) internal {
        if (_targetThreshold > maxSigners) {
            revert InvalidTargetThreshold();
        }


        targetThreshold = _targetThreshold;
    }
```

Because of that next situation is possible.
1.HatsSignerGateBase is created with `targetThreshold == minThreshold == 5`.
2.Later owner called `setTargetThreshold` with value 4. As result we have `targetThreshold == 4` and `minThreshold ==5`.
3.As `targetThreshold` is maximum threshold that is set to Safe, that means that tx that has `targetThreshold` signers will revert, because of [this check](https://github.com/Hats-Protocol/hats-zodiac/blob/9455cc0957762f5dbbd8e62063d970199109b977/src/HatsSignerGateBase.sol#L491-L493).
## Impact
Some tx will revert, when they should pass.

## Recommendation
In case if provided `targetThreshold` is less than `minThreshold`, then do `minThreshold = targetThreshold`.
