# attacker can perform malicious transactions in the safe because reentrancy is not implemented correctly in the checkTransaction() and checkAfterExecution() function in HSG

## Summary
to prevent reentrancy during the safe's `execTransaction()` function call code use `_guardEntries` and increase it in the `checkTransaction()` and decrease it in the `checkAfterExecution()`. but the logic is wrong and code won't underflow in the `checkAfterExecution()` if attacker perform reentrancy during the `execTransaction()`

## Vulnerability Detail
This is some part of the `checkTransaction()` and `checkAfterExecution()` code:
```solidity
    function checkTransaction(
        address to,
        uint256 value,
        bytes calldata data,
        Enum.Operation operation,
        uint256 safeTxGas,
        uint256 baseGas,
        uint256 gasPrice,
        address gasToken,
        address payable refundReceiver,
        bytes memory signatures,
        address // msgSender
    ) external override {
        if (msg.sender != address(safe)) revert NotCalledFromSafe();

        uint256 safeOwnerCount = safe.getOwners().length;
        // uint256 validSignerCount = _countValidSigners(safe.getOwners());

        // ensure that safe threshold is correct
        reconcileSignerCount();

        if (safeOwnerCount < minThreshold) {
            revert BelowMinThreshold(minThreshold, safeOwnerCount);
        }

        // get the tx hash; view function
        bytes32 txHash = safe.getTransactionHash(
            // Transaction info
            to,
            value,
            data,
            operation,
            safeTxGas,
            // Payment info
            baseGas,
            gasPrice,
            gasToken,
            refundReceiver,
            // Signature info
            // We subtract 1 since nonce was just incremented in the parent function call
            safe.nonce() - 1 // view function
        );

        uint256 validSigCount = countValidSignatures(txHash, signatures, signatures.length / 65);

        unchecked {
            ++_guardEntries;
        }
    }

    /// @notice Post-flight check to prevent `safe` signers from removing this contract guard, changing any modules, or changing the threshold
    /// @dev Modified from https://github.com/gnosis/zodiac-guard-mod/blob/988ebc7b71e352f121a0be5f6ae37e79e47a4541/contracts/ModGuard.sol#L86
    function checkAfterExecution(bytes32, bool) external override {
        if (msg.sender != address(safe)) revert NotCalledFromSafe();

        // leave checked to catch underflows triggered by re-erntry attempts
        --_guardEntries;
    }
```
as you can see code increase the value of the `_guardEntries` in the `checkTransaction()` which is called before the transaction execution and decrease its value in the `checkAfterExecution` which is called after transaction execution. this won't protect against reentrancy during the safe's `execTransaction()` call. attacker can perform this actions:
1. Transaction1 which has valid number of signers and set the value of the guard to 0x0. and call `safe.execTransaction(Transaction2)`.
2.  Transaction2 which reset the value of the guard to the HSG address.
3. now by calling `Tsafe.execTransaction(Transaction1)` code would first call `checkTransaction()` and would see the number of the signers is correct and then increase the value of the `_guardEntiries` to 1 and then code in safe would execute the Transaction1 which would set the guard to 0x0 and execute the Transaction2 in safe.
4. because guard is 0x0 code would execute the Transaction2 and then during that code would re-set the value of the guard to the HSG address.
5. now `checkAfterExecution()` would get exeucted and would see that guard value is correct and would decrease the `_guardEntiries`

the attack is possible by changing the value of the `threshhold` in the safe. because code would perform two increase and one decrease during the reentrancy so the underflow won't happen.


## Impact
it's possible to set guard or threshold during the execTransaction() and execute another malicious transaction which resets guard and threshold

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
set the value of the guard to 1 and decrease in the `checkTransaction()` and increase in the `checkAfterExecution()`.
