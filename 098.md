# Signatures can duplicate in function `countValidSignatures`

## Summary
Signatures can duplicate in function `countValidSignatures`
## Vulnerability Detail
In contract `HatsSignerGateBase.sol`, function `countValidSignatures` is a public function which used to count number of valid signers from the signatures. But there is not the check to prevent duplicated owners from the signatures.
## Impact
Because `countValidSignatures` is a public function, any user/protocol can use it to check their signatures. And the wrong results lead to misunderstandings for them.

## Code Snippet

## Tool used
Manual review

## Recommendation
Should add the check to prevent duplicated owners from signatures (follow contract `GnosisSafe`)
