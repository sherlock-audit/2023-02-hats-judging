# Prevent deployment of HSG when safe has more than 5 modules

## Summary

I could not figure out why it is unsafe to use a gnosis safe with more than 5 enabled modules (as described in the code), but the current proxy factory will produce a HSG with wrong `enabledModuleCount` when we attempt to deploy a new HSG with an existing safe with more than 5 modules.

## Vulnerability Detail

If the protocol considers it unsafe to have a safe with a guard HSG with more than 5 pre-existing modules, it should restrain it. In the current implementation, it is not restrained and result in a wrong value of `enabledModuleCount`.

## Impact

HSG with wrong value of `enabledModuleCount` / bricked safe contracts.

## Code Snippet

deployHatsSignerGate only gets the existing modules with a limit of 5:

This is used to set the value of `enabledModuleCount` in the HSG:

The problem is the same for deployment of `MultiHatsSignerGate`.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

In the proxy factory, get the modules with a limit of 6 and revert if the 6th value is non-zero. Note that a user could still deploy the HSG with the correct `enabledModuleCount`, add a module to the safe, and then bind the HSG to the safe. For a definite fix you'd need to have to call a function on the HSG that checks the module count of the safe before it is active.
