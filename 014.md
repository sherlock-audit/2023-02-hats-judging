# Contract breaks if `targetThreshold` is ever reduced

## Summary
The function `setTargetThreshold` allows the setting of the target threshold. If it is ever set lower than the current Threshold, the contract can get bricked.
## Vulnerability Detail
The threshold of the contract is set according to the following conditions
1. If validSigners < minThreshold, revert in checkTransaction
2. if minThreshold <= validSigners < targetThreshold, threshold = validSigners
3. If validSigners > targetThreshold, threshold = targetThreshold

If the contract is in state 2 or 3, and the target threshold is manually set to a value which is lower than the current threshold, the function `reconcileSignerCount` fails to set the threshold correctly in subsequent calls. This is because this function uses branching if-statements, and none of them are entered in this particular case
https://github.com/Hats-Protocol/hats-zodiac/blob/9455cc0957762f5dbbd8e62063d970199109b977/src/HatsSignerGateBase.sol#L198-L203
```solidity
        if (validSignerCount <= target && validSignerCount != currentThreshold) {
            newThreshold = validSignerCount;
        } else if (validSignerCount > target && currentThreshold < target) {
            newThreshold = target;
        }
        if (newThreshold > 0) {
```

For the case validSignerCount > target, and currentThreshold > target, none of these statements are entered and the threshold is not set. This creates an issue when sending transactions from the safe. This is due to a check in the post-flight `checkAfterExecution` function
https://github.com/Hats-Protocol/hats-zodiac/blob/9455cc0957762f5dbbd8e62063d970199109b977/src/HatsSignerGateBase.sol#L517-L519
```solidity
        if (safe.getThreshold() != _getCorrectThreshold()) {
            revert SignersCannotChangeThreshold();
        }
```

The function `_getCorrectThreshold` calculates the threshold correctly. 
https://github.com/Hats-Protocol/hats-zodiac/blob/9455cc0957762f5dbbd8e62063d970199109b977/src/HatsSignerGateBase.sol#L533-L540
```solidity
    function _getCorrectThreshold() internal view returns (uint256 _threshold) {
        uint256 count = _countValidSigners(safe.getOwners());
        uint256 min = minThreshold;
        uint256 max = targetThreshold;
        if (count < min) _threshold = min;
        else if (count > max) _threshold = max;
        else _threshold = count;
    }
```
However, since the `reconcileSignerCount` function didn't set the threshold correctly in the first place, the values wont match and this check will revert.
## Impact
Bricked contract due to lowering targetThreshold

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use the same logic as in `_getCorrectThreshold` to set the threshold in `reconcileSignerCount`
